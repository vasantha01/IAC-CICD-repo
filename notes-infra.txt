Increase of size of server--horizontal scaling
adding   the server--vertical scaling
---------------------------------------

Load Balancer-

diving the load equally and route the taffic is called load balancer
------------------------------
EBS

internal storage


external storage
Adding exteranl volume adding ebs volume
by default is root volume

IOPS
For every 200 iops 

1gb=300 iops
ebs used for storage

using snapshot copy the data from ebs volumes create a new volume and attach a volume to new ec2
-------------------------------------------------------------

using AMI we can spin up new instance also have an option to attach volume
ami can take backup of ebs volumes also
---------------------------------
Monitoring 


ASG-Auto scaling group

min and max 
atleast maintain 1 or 2 instances and max as 20 instances
based on threshold add or remove instances cpu utili

create an  cloud watch alarm --monitor the instances and notify
1) Launch Configuration
2) min max
3) threshold <> 60 
4) cloud watch alarm
5) ASG will be scaleup or scaledown

--------------------------------------------
cloudwatch helps to mointor -- if it cross 90% watches 
cloudwatch gives instructions to add an server -- asg take ami and add it to loadbalancer
-

1)whenever there is increase in traffic cloudwatches identifies  cpu utilization 90 CW triiger ASG -ASG Through LC takes  an AMI  and too LOAD Balancer
2)CW notifiy SNS and notify to ASG add an instance

Storage classess

Default -Standard storage-- downloads and uploads -- gives a less coast 0.005 $ --100 high availavbity

Infrequentenly access storage--- downloads and uploads accessing infrequently--price is low than standard

Reduced redudancy data-- getting it highly available --risk in loosing data--- price is low

glacier---archival data-- for uploads n download take time--- highly available-- price is too low


S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions.
